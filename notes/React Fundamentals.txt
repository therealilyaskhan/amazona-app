SINGLE PAGE APPLICATION (SPA):

THE HEAR , THE CORE OF REACT:
            "To show different components to users depending
            upon their actions while remaining on the front-end"

To understand the concept of SPAs we first have to understand the Multi Pages Applications [by pages we mean html]

MPA ARCHITECTURE:
        If you remember in php, where we had a lot of template files containing the markup such as:
        =>contact.php
        =>header.php
        =>footer.php
        =>product.php
        =>catalog.php
        =>login.php
        =>signup.php
        =>profile.php

Now we had to include inside each of the rest of the files at the top the header.php and at the end the footer.php, where all the markup was calculated on the server i:e all the queries to the database etc used to get calculated on the server and then at the end the server would respond you with a file;

For Example: i am on the homepage and there is a product, upon clicking that product, a get request (to some URL) would be sent over to the server , and based upon that URL the server would go to that particular product.php file and render that file for that very product on the server and send me back a fresh file along with the required css and javascript;

HOWEVER IN CASE OF SINGLE PAGE APPLICATIONS: 
            "this is not the case"

--> In SPA we only have one singleton .html file;
--> Only ever one dot .html file on our server, which is served to the browser in the beginning;
--> In SPA you still need to make an initial request to the server and the server gives you back that single html file;
--> After the browser receives that initial response, the REACT takes over the application;
--> As along with the .html file the server also sends over to the client JavaScript and CSS as static assets;
--> if now you click a link to the contact page, your request won't be sent over to the server but rather would be intercepted by the REACT in the browser and will be handled by the react;
--> based upon the URL there will be routing already coded, the react will say okay you want to see the components related to the contact page so the /contact request will be routed to a specific component and will load those components onto the UI;
--> So what a single page application is doing is that it is showing different components to the user on the UI based upon the user actions and what actually the user is trying to see on the screen;
--> No new html files are going to be downloaded from the server because in face there isn't any other html file on the server besides the one the user already have, all the rest of the Markup is rendered on to the browser by the "react-dom" and "babel" via JSX;
--> The beauty of react is that what it allows you to do is to only create different components and simply routing different URLs to these components;
--> what react is going to do is that it will inject different components dynamically into the root div inside of the once ever served index.html file based upon what components user is accessing; for example if a user is accessing the home page then the 'root' container in the index.html will be filled only with those components that has to do with the homepage;
--> similarly, if user accesses a product page, the stuff currently filled inside the 'root' container will be replaced with new components that has to do with product page;
--> Requests are made to the server but not for the markup, only for the data that is required by the requested page;
--> when using react you almost never have to work with the .html markup files , all of your concern is going to be inside of the JavaScript files; Whether it is to add markup, you will do it form inside of the javascript files, even if it comes to adding styles to your markup you have to include / import your style sheets inside of the JavaScript file(s) [this is what webpack takes care of];
--> when you have to add styles which are global to all the components then you will add those styles to a file index.css inside the src folder in your react app; this index.css file is imported into the index.js file inside the same src folder, and this index.js is the file which is going to render / mount react components to the 'root' container inside the index.html file that lives inside the public folder;
--> and in case when you want to add styles that are specific to only a particular component; then you have to import such css file at the top of that very component;
--> remember in a react application it is only one single ReactDOM.render() call at the end of the day that is going to mount a single react functional component called <App /> on a 'root' container inside the html markup file; and from inside of that function react component called "App" we are going to refer to all other different components as its children and will route different URLs to different components from inside of it;

public Folder:
        In this folder there is going to be everything that is going to be served to the client like images, the html file etc;

src Folder:
        We create our components inside this folder;
        create react app by default creates for us an <App /> component inside of this src folder in a file names App.js;
        the index.js in src folder is responsible for rendering the components to the DOM (inside the index.html file on the root container;)
        Here is also where you add css files which will be specific to certain components you add in this src folder;
        In here is going to be all the source files, here is where we are going to spend most of our time and do our modifications such as adding components etc, creating different subfolders for components;
