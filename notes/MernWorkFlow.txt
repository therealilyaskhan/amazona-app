1) First of all you create a new folder

2) git init

3) connect local repo to remote github repo

4) npm init

5) create frontend and backend folders inside this root folder

6) in the frontend folder it is react app 

7) in the backend it is Express(built on top of nodejs)

8) this whole root folder containing both the frontend and backend folder is you application layer so called the "client" (client of the data layer) which is going to communicate with the database via a NodeJS driver for MongoDB

9) in the backend folder you then install "mongoose"

10) "mongoose" lets "express" communicate with mongoDB remote server;

11) you create a mongoDB cluster on atlas which is actually you mongoDB server that is going to listen for queries from application layer via NodeJS library "mongoose"

12) Express plays a vital role ; a role of a middleman;

13) Both frontend and backend (the whole application layer) will be on the same server;

14) this server is going to listen at a certain port for http requests

15) a client of the application layer (not of the Data layer) is going to send an http request to the socket on which your app lives;

16) express listens to this request and responds back the static html index file;

17) express is basically a router and middleware framework that routes the user's http request to a certain middleware function based upon the URL and METHOD;

Now here a confusion may raise:
          Then who handles the subsequent http requests of the client for some other pages of the web app ? is it express ? or is it the browser that intercepts the subsequent requests of the user ?

          Yes:
          Remember that your express server is only going to handle the initial http request from the browser; When you build your react app, you get a build folder inside which everything is concat and compressed, there is an index.html file which is the main entry to your entire react application; 

          On any type of initial user request:
          The express server is going to respond the user with this index.html static file;
          AND:
          --> After the browser receives that initial response, the REACT takes over the application;
          --> As along with the .html file the server also sends over to the client: JavaScript and CSS bundles as static assets;
          --> if now you click a link to the contact page, your request won't be sent over to the server but rather would be intercepted by the REACT in the browser and will be handled by "react-router-dom" contained in the JS bundles sent over to the client side on his first request to express;
          --> based upon the URL there will be routing already coded by us inside and each time the URL in the the routes defined by us will be checked by 'react-router-dom' and will render a different component onto the browser screen; The <BrowserRouter> creates its own history instance, and listens for changes on that and this instance is like a queue on the top of which resides the current URL;
          --> So what a single page application is doing is that it is showing different components to the user on the UI based upon the change in the browser URL history instance;

18) So one thing is for sure that:
                    Requests for UI markup and styles and javascript interactivity are only entertained by the express server for the first time and any subsequent request for UI markup and styles are intercepted by the browser and hence handled; they are not let to the express server;

But What if the components served by the browser based upon a URL are not having static content but are having dynamic content which needs to be fetched from the database ?

i:e What if the user goes to www.amazona.com/products

Now based upon the URL above, the 'react-router-dom' library will serve the user with all the JSX to HTML markup, styles, and JS but the list of products inside this component shall not be static; it shall be dynamic;

So what is going to happen is:

19) 'react-router-dom' will serve the UI component <Products /> based upon the url above

20) we will have 'products' as state inside the redux store which will be empty at the time of when the <Product /> is mount;

21) after the component is mounted

22) get request will be sent over to express server at a particular endpoint (/api/products);

23) the express server is going to receive the get request;

24) express is going to route this request to a particular response handler or middleware function for the route:
                app.get(/api/products)

25) the request handler function is going to have a connection to the mongoDB database via the mongoose;

26) a query will be sent to the mongoDB Server for the list of products inside the handler function;

27) the mongoDB server will peek into the database and will return to its client which is "express" with the results of the query;

28) express will get the data from the database;

29) and will stream the results back to the browser as a response to the http request;

30) browser is going to receive the http response and upon the response a dot then callback will be executed inside which we will dispatch an action to update the 'products' state inside the redux store; 

31) after the redux store is updated; 

32) the <Products /> will be re-rendered and this time we have all the dynamic products from the database which we will render to the UI;
